We expect the same result in any pending litigation."She added: "Any examination of the records of our grant programs will find that they are highly effective and conducted in cooperation with the Department of Justice and in compliance with all Department of Justice requirements.

Our federal grant-funded Sexual Assault Kit Initiative has been cited by the United States Attorney General as a model program. We are proud of our grant programs and our partnership with the Department of Justice that makes Fulton County a safer, more just place."Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, center, indicted former President Trump and others in Georgia over efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss in the state.(AP Photo/John Bazemore)It comes after theJudiciary Committeerequested the documents on three different occasions, in Aug. 2023, Sept. 2023, and Dec. 2023.GA SENATE LAUNCHES COMMITTEE TO PROBE TRUMP PROSECUTOR FANI WILLIS FOR 'IMPROPER' AFFAIR"To date, you have failed to comply voluntarily with any of our requests," the committee wrote in a letter to Willis.House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep.
