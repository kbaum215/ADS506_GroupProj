closeVideoBiden hauls in $70 million in donations from Hollywood, billionairesFox News contributor Joe Concha joined ‘FOX & Friends First’ to discuss Biden's massive fundraising overhaul and a new report detailing how Biden refers to Trump behind closed doors.President Biden'sthoughts about former President Trump appear to be more vulgar behind closed doors than in public despite him and other Democrats routinely calling for "civility" and "decency" in politics.On Biden's first day in office, he lectured his staff about the importance of respect and said, "I am not joking when I say this, if you are ever working with me and I hear you treat another colleague with disrespect, talk down to someone, I promise you I will fire you on the spot. On the spot. No ifs, ands or buts."However, Biden has been at the center of multiple reports detailing how he's prone to outbursts and "angry interrogations" of staff when not in the public eye. That demeanor appears to have continued as the president takes aim at Trump in private to his close allies and aides.During conversations with his confidantes, Biden has allegedly referred to Trump as a "sick f---" who enjoys seeing others encounter setbacks, Politico reported Thursday.WH AIDES CLAIM BIDEN PRONE TO OUTBURSTS, ‘ANGRY INTERROGATIONS’ BEHIND CLOSED DOORS: ‘GET THE F—K OUT’President Biden, left, allegedly called former President Donald Trump a "sick f---" behind closed doors.(Getty Images)The publication spoke to three individuals who heard Biden make the remarks. One of those individuals added Biden also recentlycalled Trumpa "f---ing a--hole."Trump's campaign fired back at the president for his alleged comments."It’s a shame that Crooked Joe Biden disrespects the presidency both publicly and privately," senior Trump campaign adviserChris Lacivita told Politico. "But then again, it’s no surprise he disrespects the 45th president the same way he disrespects the American people with his failed policies."BIDEN’S HISTORY OF BERATING, SCOLDING AND INSULTING REPORTERS, FROM ‘STUPID SON OF A B----’ TO ‘GET EDUCATED’Biden has reportedly been prone to outbursts in private.(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)Conservatives took to social media Thursday evening blasting Biden for his comments about Trump.Steve Guest, who previously worked for Sen.

"Rule of law and whatnot. I am sure Trump's defense attorneys are VERY interested in this for selective prosecution claims.""Biden has always been a lowlife and ignoramus," Fox News' Mark Levinposted on X.A White House spokesman, when asked for comment by Fox News Digital, used the word "snowflake" to describe media coverage of the president's foul language.Past reports have suggested Biden is inclined to yell at White House aides behind closed doors and drag them in for "angry interrogations." The reports have alleged Biden has such a "quick-trigger temper" that some White House staffers attempt to dodge meeting him one-on-one."Some take a colleague, almost as a shield against a solo blast,"Biden aides said last summer.The president's alleged outbursts have included expressions such as "God d---it, how the f--- don't you know this?!," "Don't f---ing bulls--- me!" and "Get the f--- out of here!"Biden's tactics generally came in the form of "angry interrogations" until it became apparent to others in the room that they didn't know the answer to a question. It allegedly became so routine that staff named it "stump the chump."White House aides have allegedly tried to dodge one-on-one meetings with the president.(Jacquelyn Martin/AP/Bloomberg via Getty Images)CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP"No one is safe," one administration official previously said.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.Fox News Digital's Nikolas Lanum contributed to this report.Joe Schoffstall is a politics producer/reporter for Fox News Digital.
